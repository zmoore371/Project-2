Create a login to begin planning your trip. Once logged in, search for the city you are going to for reviews on museums, hiking, restaurants, hotels, skate parks, and anything else other members have done that they found to be fun. Or things that they definitely do not recommend. 

If you search for your city, a list of reviews from other members will be listed with a name, address, review, and recommend yes or no. Find plenty of activities to fill your time in this new city!

If you search for a city and there is no data, you are the first member traveling to this city! Once youâ€™ve had your trip, login to your account and write reviews on the things that you did, places you went, and things you experienced that you think other members would enjoy too.
