They have cool tanks, but not much information listed anywhere to know what they are in those tanks, you are given a map at the entrance (1 per household) and was quickly damaged by falling water. Useless ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è... You can go through the whole place in a short time. We chose to check out the 4D theater and all I have to say is that it's not worth it at all, they gave us 3d glasses that are all dirty or damaged, the screen is full and not bright at all, supposedly they have wind sound but all I heard was an old fan making noise to make wind. Pretty lame. Save your $ on that.",
