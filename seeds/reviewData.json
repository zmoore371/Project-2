    "review": "Very cool looking aquarium from the outside, we bought the Denver city pass and this saved us a lot on the admission cost, once inside all the attractions are in the second floor, bathrooms are in the first floor, so better go before going up!.  They have cool tanks, but not much information listed anywhere to know what they are in those tanks, you are given a map at the entrance (1 per household) and was quickly damaged by falling water. Useless ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è... You can go through the whole place in a short time. We chose to check out the 4D theater and all I have to say is that it's not worth it at all, they gave us 3d glasses that are all dirty or damaged, the screen is full and not bright at all, supposedly they have wind sound but all I heard was an old fan making noise to make wind. Pretty lame. Save your $ on that.",

Next time we don't share! The sandwich is the best I've ever had. Perfect balance of savory meat and kimchi wrapped up in a unique flat bread that doesn't get soggy. üòã  Friendly staff and vibe. Can't get back soon enough with friends in tow!",

They gave us a voucher to go on a cruise later, but $15k is a lot of money to have to eat, and who knows if we will be healthy enough to go on a cruise by the time it's ok to travel again.  We are older. We aren't happy with this cruise line.  If we are able to go on a cruise sometime with this line to use our voucher, it will be the one and only time we do so. Shame on you Uncruise.  The airlines were very accommodating in refunding all of our money.",
